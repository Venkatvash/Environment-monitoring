## 
Phase 1
Environmental monitoring refers to the tools and techniques designed to observe an environment, characterize its quality, and establish environmental parameters, for the purpose of accurately quantifying the impact an activity has on an environment. Results are gathered, analyzed statistically, and then published in a risk assessment and environmental monitoring and impact assessment reporting
As human population, industrial activities, and energy consumption continues to grow, the continued development of advanced, automated monitoring applications and devices is crucial for enhancing the accuracy of environmental monitoring reports and the cost-effectiveness of the environmental monitoring process. ‍

Monitoring programs are published outlines within an organization that detail precisely which elements are being monitored, overall objectives, specific strategies, proposed sampling methods, projects within each strategy, and time frames. ‍

Environmental monitoring products and environmental monitoring software, such as Environmental Data Management Systems (EDMS), facilitate the implementation and monitoring of environmental monitoring and assessment programs, which includes a central data management hub, automated environmental monitoring alerts, compliance checking, validation, quality control, and generation of reports on dataset comparisons. ‍

Environmental Monitoring Types
The three main types of environmental monitoring are soil, atmosphere, and water. Some techniques of environmental scanning and monitoring include filtration, sedimentation, electrostatic samples, impingers, absorption, condensation, grab sampling, and composite sampling. ‍

Data collected from these methods of environmental monitoring can be input into a DBMS, where it can be categorized, analyzed, visualized, and create actionable insights that drive informed decision making. ‍

Air Monitoring:
Environmental data gathered using specialized observation tools, such as sensor networks and Geographic Information System (GIS) models, from multiple different environmental networks and institutes is integrated into air dispersion models, which combine emissions, meteorological, and topographic data to detect and predict concentration of air pollutants. Soil Monitoring: Grab sampling (individual samples) and composite sampling (multiple samples) are used to monitor soil, set baselines, and detect threats such as acidification, biodiversity loss, compaction, contamination, erosion, organic material loss, salinization, and slope instability.

Salinity Monitoring:
Remote sensing, GIS, and electromagnetic induction are used to monitor soil salinity, which, if imbalanced, can cause detrimental effects on water quality, infrastructure, and plant yield.

Contamination Monitoring:
Chemical techniques such as chromatography and spectrometry are used to measure toxic elements, such as nuclear waste, coal ash, microplastics, petrochemicals, and acid rain, which can lead to the development of pollution-related diseases if consumed by humans or animals.

Erosion Monitoring:
Monitoring and modeling soil erosion is a complex process in which accurate predictions are nearly impossible for large areas. The Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) is most commonly used to try to predict soil loss due to water erosion. Erosion may be due to factors such as rainfall, surface runoff, rivers, streams, floods, wind, mass movement, climate, soil composition and structure, topography, and lack of vegetation management.

Water Monitoring:
Environmental sampling techniques include judgmental, simple random, stratified, systematic and grid, adaptive cluster, grab, and passive; semi-continuous and continuous environmental monitoring; remote sensing and environmental monitoring; and bio-monitoring are used to measure and monitor ranges for biological, chemical, radiological, microbiological, and population parameters.

#include <HTTPClient.h>

#include <DHT.h>

const char* ssid = "Your_SSID";

const char* password = "Your_Password";

const char* serverUrl = "https://smartenviron.free.beeceptor.com/smartenviron/";

#define DHTPIN 4

void setup() {

Serial.begin(9600);

Serial.print("Connecting to WiFi");

// Attempt to connect to WiFi

WiFi.begin(ssid, password);

while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {

CODE DISCRIPTION:
This Arduino sketch is designed to create a robust environment monitoring system. It utilizes a DHT22

sensor to capture temperature and humidity data and wirelessly transmits this data to a designated server

via Wi-Fi. The core functionalities encompass Wi-Fi network connectivity, sensor data acquisition, and

periodic data transmission.

Initialization and Wi-Fi Connection:
The sketch starts by initializing the Serial communication for debugging purposes with a baud rate of

9600.It then attempts to connect to a Wi-Fi network using the provided SSID (Service Set Identifier) and

password.During the connection process, the sketch displays a series of dots to indicate the connection

status. If a connection is established, it informs the user with a "Connected!" message. If not, it signals that

Wi-Fi is not connected.

Main Loop:
The primary loop continually checks the Wi-Fi connection status. If the connection is lost, it enters a

reconnection phase, calling the connectToWiFi() function.When the Wi-Fi connection is stable, the sketch

monitors the time elapsed since the last data transmission. It waits for a specified interval (in this case, one

minute) before checking the sensor for new temperature and humidity readings.If fresh data is available

and is significantly different from the previous readings (with predefined thresholds of 0.5°C for

temperature and 1.0% for humidity), it proceeds to send the updated data to the server.Wi-Fi Reconnection Function (connectToWiFi): This function is responsible for reconnecting to the Wi-Fi network in case of a connection loss. It employs a loop to repeatedly attempt connection and displays progress dots. When a successful reconnection occurs, it prints "WiFi reconnected!".

Data Transmission Function (sendSensorData):
This function constructs a URL to the designated server, incorporating the temperature and humidity data as query parameters.

It initiates an HTTP GET request to the server using the HTTPClient library.The function then evaluates the HTTP response code to confirm the success of the transmission.In the event of success, it prints the server's response.If the HTTP request fails, it reports an error code.

ADDITIONAL FEATURES:
Error Handling: Improve error handling to handle network or server issues gracefully.

Modularize Code:
Break the code into smaller functions for better organization and readability.

Minimize String Usage:
Avoid using the String class, as it can cause memory fragmentation on microcontrollers. Use character arrays (char[]) for data instead.

Reduce HTTP Requests:
Instead of sending data in every loop iteration, consider sending data at longer intervals or only when there's a significant change in sensor values.

Mobile App Development:
To connect your environmental monitoring IoT project with a mobile app, you'll need to establish a communication link between your IoT devices or sensors and the mobile app. Here are the steps to connect your IoT project to a mobile app

Choose the Right Communication Protocol:
You need to select a communication protocol that your IoT devices and the mobile app can both support. Some common protocols for IoT communication include MQTT, HTTP/HTTPS, CoAP, and WebSockets. Choose the one that fits your project's requirements.

Set Up a Cloud Platform:
It's often a good practice to have a cloud platform as an intermediary between your IoT devices and the mobile app. Cloud platforms like AWS IoT, Azure IoT Hub, or Google Cloud IoT Core provide the infrastructure to manage and process data from IoT devices.

Device Registration and Authentication:
Register your IoT devices on the cloud platform and set up authentication and security mechanisms. This typically involves generating API keys, certificates, or tokens to ensure secure communication.

Data Ingestion:
Configure the IoT devices to send data to the cloud platform using the chosen communication protocol. This data can include environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, or air quality.

Mobile App Development:
Choose the appropriate mobile app development platform (e.g., iOS, Android). Develop the mobile app with features for data visualization, user registration, and settings. Implement user authentication and security for the mobile app to access the IoT data. Integrate libraries or SDKs for communication with the cloud platform using the chosen protocol. Ensure secure communication. Real-time Data Display: Design the mobile app's user interface to display real-time data from your IoT devices. This could include charts, graphs, or numerical values that update as new data arrives.

User Alerts and Notifications:
Implement push notifications or in-app alerts to inform users of significant environmental changes or system events. These notifications can be triggered based on the data received from the IoT devices.

User Registration and Management:
Allow users to register and manage their accounts within the mobile app, including setting preferences and configuring alert thresholds.

Testing and Debugging:
Thoroughly test the mobile app to ensure that it can successfully communicate with the IoT devices and cloud platform. Debug any issues that arise during the testing phase.

Deployment:
Publish the mobile app on app stores (e.g., Apple App Store and Google Play Store) for users to download and install.

User Training and Documentation:
Provide users with training and documentation on how to use the mobile app and understand the environmental data it presents.

Maintenance and Updates:
Regularly maintain and update both the mobile app and the IoT devices' firmware to address bugs, add new features, and improve security.

Monitoring and Analytics:
Implement analytics and monitoring tools to track app usage and IoT device performance. This can help you identify issues and optimize the system.

Program:
Creating a Python program for an environmental monitoring IoT project that connects to a mobile app involves several steps. I'll provide an example Python code snippet for a simplified scenario to get you started. This example assumes you have a cloud-based IoT platform for data storage and retrieval. You can adapt this code to your specific project requirements. Code: import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt import json

-# MQTT configuration mqtt_broker = "your-mqtt-broker.com" mqtt_port = 1883 mqtt_topic = "environmental_data"

-# Replace with your authentication credentials username = "your_username" password = "your_password"

-# Create an MQTT client client = mqtt.Client() client.username_pw_set(username, password)

-# Callback function when connected to MQTT broker def on_connect(client, userdata, flags, rc): print("Connected to MQTT Broker with result code " + str(rc)) # Subscribe to the topic client.subscribe(mqtt_topic)

-# Callback function when a message is received def on_message(client, userdata, msg): payload = json.loads(msg.payload.decode()) # Process the received data temperature = payload["temperature"] humidity = payload["humidity"] air_quality = payload["air_quality"] # You can process the data further or send it to the mobile app

-# Set callback functions client.on_connect = on_connect client.on_message = on_message

-# Connect to MQTT broker client.connect(mqtt_broker, mqtt_port, 60)

-# Start the MQTT client loop client.loop_start()

-# Your code to send data to the mobile app -# You can use a library like Flask to create a REST API or use a WebSocket library to send data in real-time.

-# In a real-world scenario, you would have additional logic to process and send data to the mobile app.

-# Keep the script running try: while True: pass except KeyboardInterrupt: client.disconnect() print("Disconnected from MQTT Broker")

In this Python script:
We use the paho-mqtt library to create an MQTT client to communicate with your IoT devices.

Replace the placeholders like your-mqtt-broker.com, username, and password with your specific MQTT broker and authentication details.

The on_connect function is called when the script successfully connects to the MQTT broker. It subscribes to the environmental_data topic, where your IoT devices send data.

The on_message function is called when a message is received on the subscribed topic. It decodes the JSON data and processes it. You can adapt this function to handle the environmental data and send it to your mobile app.

The script sets the callback functions and connects to the MQTT broker.

The main loop keeps the script running to receive and process data from the MQTT broker
real-time data that can be analyzed to make informed decisions about environmental
conservation, resource management, and public health.

Overall, innovation in environmental monitoring is essential for improving our
understanding of the environment, making informed decisions, and taking steps towards a
more sustainable and eco-friendly future.
